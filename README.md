# multi-cloud-mirror
A Github copy of Joe Emison's multi-cloud-mirror script (https://code.google.com/p/multi-cloud-mirror/ )

The latest copy of the script was on https://github.com/PeerJ/multi-cloud-mirror and this repo is my fork of it for some changes and fixes I needed. I'll create pull requests for all of my changes, so you really shouldn't be checking out my fork ;)

Changes so far:
* fixed a small bug in the error reporting
* tried adding multipart upload (thanks to http://codeinpython.blogspot.de/2015/08/s3-upload-large-files-to-amazon-using.html )
